# UC Berkeley CS61B - Data Structures 2021 Spring

## Welcome to CS 61B 
The CS 61 series is an introduction to Computer Science, with particular emphasis on software and machines from a programmerâ€™s point of view. CS 61A covered high-level approaches to problem-solving, providing you with a variety of ways to organize solutions to programming problems as compositions of functions, collections of objects, or sets of rules. In CS 61B, we move to a somewhat more detailed (and to some extent, more basic) level of programming by focusing particularly on the efficiency of writing programs (design) and running programs (runtime).

Here's links to the relevant materials:

## Tooling

61B uses some tools to run its course. These are the open-source ones that
we maintain for ourselves and actively use.

- [IntelliJ Plugin][plugin] - A style checker
- [Java Visualizer][] - An IntelliJ plugin to visualize the data layout in
  Java applications. Externally maintained.
- [jh61b][] - A JUnit executor to output test results in [Gradescope's format][]
- [BSAG][] - A Better SimpleAutograder for custom Gradescope logic
  - [bsag-jh61b] - BSAG steps for jh61b components
